# Generative AI for End-to-End Limit Order Book Modelling
## A Token-Level Autoregressive Generative Model of Message Flow Using a Deep State Space Network

This repository provides the implementation for the
paper: Generative AI for End-to-End Limit Order Book Modelling. The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00638).

The repository is a fork of [the original S5 repository](https://github.com/lindermanlab/S5).

Developing a generative model of realistic order flow in financial markets is a challenging open problem, with numerous applications for market participants. Addressing this, we propose the first end-to-end autoregressive generative model that generates tokenized limit order book (LOB) messages. These messages are interpreted by a Jax-LOB simulator, which updates the LOB state. To handle long sequences efficiently, the model employs \emph{simplified structured state-space layers} to process sequences of order book states and tokenized messages. Using LOBSTER data of NASDAQ equity LOBs, we develop a custom tokenizer for message data, converting groups of successive digits to tokens, similar to tokenization in large language models.

## Requirements & Installation

To install required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The GPU installation of JAX can cause problems, further instructions are available [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

## Data Download

The data used is NASDAQ LOB data from [LOBSTER](https://lobsterdata.com/index.php).
After downloading and unpacking the data files, they need to be pre-processed for model training. An example command for GOOG is as follows:

`python lob/preproc.py --data_dir /path/to/LOBS5/data/GOOG/ --save_dir /path/to/LOBS5/data/GOOG/ --n_tick_range 500 --use_raw_book_repr`
